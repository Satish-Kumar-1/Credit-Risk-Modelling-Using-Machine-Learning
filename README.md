# Credit-Risk-Modelling-Using-Machine-Learning
Design a multi-class classifier for a bank to predict whether a customer belongs to class P1, P2, P3, or P4.
### Business Interpretation for Machine Learning Project

In this project, we categorize customers into four distinct classes based on their credit bill and loan repayment behaviors. Each class represents a different level of risk for the bank:

- **Class P1**: 
  - **Description**: This class includes the best customers who pay their credit bills or loan repayments before the due date.
  - **Risk Appetite**: Low. These customers demonstrate excellent financial responsibility, resulting in minimal risk for the bank.

- **Class P2**: 
  - **Description**: This class consists of the second-best customers who pay their credit bills or loan repayments on the due date.
  - **Risk Appetite**: Moderate. While these customers meet their financial obligations on time, the bank faces a slightly higher risk compared to Class P1 due to the lack of early payments.

- **Class P3**: 
  - **Description**: This class includes customers who pay their credit bills or loan repayments late, after the due date.
  - **Risk Appetite**: High. These customers pose a significant risk to the bank as they demonstrate delayed payment behaviors, potentially leading to cash flow issues and higher default rates.

- **Class P4**: 
  - **Description**: This class comprises the worst customers who pay their credit bills or loan repayments late or skip payments altogether.
  - **Risk Appetite**: Severely High. These customers are the most risky for the bank, exhibiting poor financial responsibility and a high likelihood of defaulting on their obligations.

By segmenting customers into these classes, the bank can tailor its strategies and risk management practices to better address the financial behaviors and associated risks of each group.
